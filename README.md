Welcome to the GitHub repository for PlayHalving! PlayHalving is a decentralized game built on the Solana blockchain, offering a community-driven experience where precision and timing turn predictions into rewards. Players predict the exact date and time of the next Bitcoin Halving and could win up to 100,000 USDT.

## How It Works
- **Connect Your Wallet**: Start by connecting your digital wallet to participate.
- **Make Your Prediction**: Predict the exact date and time of the next Bitcoin Halving.
- **Win Rewards**: If your prediction is accurate down to the millisecond, you share in a substantial prize pool.

## Features
- **Decentralized**: Fully operated via a transparent smart contract.
- **Secure**: Funds are held securely in the smart contract until the halving event occurs.
- **Fair**: No central authority; the smart contract rules ensure a level playing field.
